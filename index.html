<h3>Laptop Stickers: The One Trend That Will Never End <small>1/20/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://collegian.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_8658-1024x683.jpg">
<p>When walking around campus, trying to spot a laptop without multiple stickers on the back is nearly impossible. Most laptops, nowadays, are covered in stickers ranging from: quotes from television shows to brand logos. Personally, I don’t have any laptop stickers, so I’ve always wondered how meaningful those stickers really are to individuals. I, being the ever so nosey individual I am, asked…</p>

<h3>Is Backpacking Still A Thing? <small>1/13/2019</small></h3>

<p>Throughout the years, backpacking has decreased in popularity among young adults. What was once on the top of everyone’s bucket list has been replaced, forgotten. The activity doesn’t spark peoples’ interests like it used to, especially now that people can only go without their phone or social media accounts for so long. Backpacking was the go-to activity to try around 2012, when the book Wild by Cheryl Strayed was published…</p>

<p>As the new year approaches, I am starting to think about those pesky new year resolutions everyone is starting to make. My past resolutions, like many other peoples’ resolutions, have been centered on weight loss or becoming healthier. But let’s all face the facts, those resolutions are usually forgotten by the end of the month. This year, instead of doing the same old resolutions, I want to try something new. To get some extra inspiration, I’ve been looking at some resolutions on Pinterest and…</p>

<p>Coming from the girl, who changed her major three times so far, I’m going to have to say choosing a major might be one of the hardest things about college. From everything you’ve heard, choosing a major basically determines the jobs you will have in the future, so picking the right major is important and very stressful. Another hard part about picking a major is the time you have to pick one. If you have financial aid, you only have so many years… </p>
